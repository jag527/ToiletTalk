In this deployed backend, there are database models for storing all messages on our app, all locations (and their associated passcodes + messages sent) from which people can post messages, as well as a leaderboard for tracking where messages are being sent from. In addition, though it is not deployed on the frontend, the backend has a model for storing images that users can post in addition to the deployed messages posted. For messages, the API supports the ability to post a message, get all messages, get a message by its id, and delete a message by its id. For locations, the API has a route for a user posting a ‘login’ attempt to the chatroom, which in this case, is simply inputting a location and its passcode. We deemed it that authentication was NOT the proper thing to use here, because our app is being viewed more as a locked chatroom as opposed to a user-focused forum such as Reddit or SideChat. For the leaderboard, the API allows for the leaderboard (locations and their associated counters) to be shown. And for images, the API supports the ability to upload and image.
